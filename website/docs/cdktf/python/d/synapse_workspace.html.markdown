class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        data_azurerm_synapse_workspace_example =
        azurerm.data_azurerm_synapse_workspace.DataAzurermSynapseWorkspace(self, "example",
            name="existing",
            resource_group_name="example-resource-group"
        )
        cdktf.TerraformOutput(self, "id",
