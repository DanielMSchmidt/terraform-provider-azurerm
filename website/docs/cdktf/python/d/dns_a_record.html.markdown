# Data Source: azurerm_dns_a_record

Use this data source to access information about an existing DNS A Record within Azure DNS.

~> **Note:** [The Azure DNS API has a throttle limit of 500 read (GET) operations per 5 minutes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/request-limits-and-throttling#network-throttling) - whilst the default read timeouts will work for most cases - in larger configurations you may need to set a larger [read timeout](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) then the default 5min. Although, we'd generally recommend that you split the resources out into smaller Terraform configurations to avoid the problem entirely.

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.azurerm as azurerm
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        data_azurerm_dns_aRecord_example =
        azurerm.data_azurerm_dns_aRecord.DataAzurermDnsARecord(self, "example",
            name="test",
            resource_group_name="test-rg",
            zone_name="test-zone"
        )
        cdktf.TerraformOutput(self, "dns_a_record_id",
            value=data_azurerm_dns_aRecord_example.id
        )
```

## Argument Reference

* `name` - The name of the DNS A Record.

* `resource_group_name` - Specifies the resource group where the DNS Zone (parent resource) exists.

* `zone_name` - Specifies the DNS Zone where the resource exists.

## Attributes Reference

* `id` - The DNS A Record ID.

* `fqdn` - The FQDN of the DNS A Record.

* `ttl` - The Time To Live (TTL) of the DNS record in seconds.

* `records` - List of IPv4 Addresses.

* `target_resource_id` - The Azure resource id of the target object from where the dns resource value is taken.

* `tags` - A mapping of tags assigned to the DNS A Record.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the DNS A Record.
