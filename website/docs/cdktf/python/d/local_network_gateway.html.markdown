# Data Source: azurerm_local_network_gateway

Use this data source to access information about an existing Local Network Gateway.

## Example Usage

import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.azurerm as azurerm
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        data_azurerm_local_network_gateway_example =
        azurerm.data_azurerm_local_network_gateway.DataAzurermLocalNetworkGateway(self, "example",
            name="existing-local-network-gateway",
            resource_group_name="existing-resources"
        )
        cdktf.TerraformOutput(self, "id",
            value=data_azurerm_local_network_gateway_example.id
        )
```
