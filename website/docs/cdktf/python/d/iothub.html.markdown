import ...gen.providers.azurerm as azurerm
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        data_azurerm_iothub_example =
        azurerm.data_azurerm_iothub.DataAzurermIothub(self, "example",
            name="existing",
            resource_group_name="existing"
        )
