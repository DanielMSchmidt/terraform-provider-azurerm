import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.azurerm as azurerm
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        data_azurerm_recovery_services_vault_vault =
        azurerm.data_azurerm_recovery_services_vault.DataAzurermRecoveryServicesVault(self, "vault",
            name="tfex-recovery_vault",
            resource_group_name="tfex-resource_group"
        )
        azurerm.data_azurerm_site_recovery_replication_recovery_plan.DataAzurermSiteRecoveryReplicationRecoveryPlan(self, "example",
            name="example-recovery-plan",
            recovery_vault_id=cdktf.Token.as_string(data_azurerm_recovery_services_vault_vault.id)
        )
