# Data Source: azurerm_subnet

Use this data source to access information about an existing Subnet within a Virtual Network.

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.azurerm as azurerm
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        data_azurerm_subnet_example =
        azurerm.data_azurerm_subnet.DataAzurermSubnet(self, "example",
            name="backend",
            resource_group_name="networking",
            virtual_network_name="production"
        )
        cdktf.TerraformOutput(self, "subnet_id",
            value=data_azurerm_subnet_example.id
        )
```
