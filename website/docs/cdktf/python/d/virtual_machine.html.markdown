# Data Source: azurerm_virtual_machine

Use this data source to access information about an existing Virtual Machine.

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.azurerm as azurerm
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        azurerm.provider.AzurermProvider(self, "azurerm",
            features=AzurermProviderFeatures()
        )
        data_azurerm_virtual_machine_example =
        azurerm.data_azurerm_virtual_machine.DataAzurermVirtualMachine(self, "example",
            name="production",
            resource_group_name="networking"
        )
        cdktf.TerraformOutput(self, "virtual_machine_id",
            value=data_azurerm_virtual_machine_example.id
        )
```

## Argument Reference

* `name` - Specifies the name of the Virtual Machine.

* `resource_group_name` - Specifies the name of the resource group the Virtual Machine is located in.

## Attributes Reference

* `id` - The ID of the Virtual Machine.

* `identity` - A `identity` block as defined below.

* `private_ip_address` - The Primary Private IP Address assigned to this Virtual Machine.

* `private_ip_addresses` - A list of Private IP Addresses assigned to this Virtual Machine.

* `public_ip_address` - The Primary Public IP Address assigned to this Virtual Machine.

* `public_ip_addresses` - A list of the Public IP Addresses assigned to this Virtual Machine.

* `power_state` - The power state of the virtual machine.

~> In this release there's a known issue where the `public_ip_address` and `public_ip_addresses` fields may not be fully populated for Dynamic Public IP's.

An `identity` block exports the following:

* `identity_ids` - The list of User Managed Identity IDs which are assigned to the Virtual Machine.

* `principal_id` - The ID of the System Managed Service Principal assigned to the Virtual Machine.

* `tenant_id` - The ID of the Tenant of the System Managed Service Principal assigned to the Virtual Machine.

* `type` - The identity type of the Managed Identity assigned to the Virtual Machine.
