# azurerm_local_network_gateway

Manages a local network gateway connection over which specific connections can be configured.

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.azurerm as azurerm
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        azurerm_resource_group_example = azurerm.resource_group.ResourceGroup(self, "example",
            location="West Europe",
            name="localNetworkGWTest"
        )
        azurerm.local_network_gateway.LocalNetworkGateway(self, "home",
            address_space=["10.0.0.0/16"],
            gateway_address="12.13.14.15",
            location=cdktf.Token.as_string(azurerm_resource_group_example.location),
            name="backHome",
            resource_group_name=cdktf.Token.as_string(azurerm_resource_group_example.name)
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the local network gateway. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to create the local network gateway. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) The location/region where the local network gateway is created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `address_space` - (Optional) The list of string CIDRs representing the address spaces the gateway exposes.

* `bgp_settings` - (Optional) A `bgp_settings` block as defined below containing the Local Network Gateway's BGP speaker settings.

* `gateway_address` - (Optional) The gateway IP address to connect with.

* `gateway_fqdn` - (Optional) The gateway FQDN to connect with.

-> **NOTE:** Either `gateway_address` or `gateway_fqdn` should be specified.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

---

The `bgp_settings` block supports the following:

* `asn` - (Required) The BGP speaker's ASN.

* `bgp_peering_address` - (Required) The BGP peering address and BGP identifier of this BGP speaker.

* `peer_weight` - (Optional) The weight added to routes learned from this BGP speaker.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Local Network Gateway.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Local Network Gateway.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Local Network Gateway.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Local Network Gateway.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Local Network Gateway.

## Import

Local Network Gateways can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_local_network_gateway.lng1 /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.Network/localNetworkGateways/lng1
```
