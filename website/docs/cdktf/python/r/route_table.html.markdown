# azurerm_route_table

Manages a Route Table

~> **NOTE on Route Tables and Routes:** Terraform currently
provides both a standalone [Route resource](route.html), and allows for Routes to be defined in-line within the [Route Table resource](route_table.html).
At this time you cannot use a Route Table with in-line Routes in conjunction with any Route resources. Doing so will cause a conflict of Route configurations and will overwrite Routes.

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.azurerm as azurerm
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        azurerm_resource_group_example = azurerm.resource_group.ResourceGroup(self, "example",
            location="West Europe",
            name="example-resources"
        )
        azurerm_route_table_example = azurerm.route_table.RouteTable(self, "example_1",
            disable_bgp_route_propagation=False,
            location=cdktf.Token.as_string(azurerm_resource_group_example.location),
            name="example-route-table",
            resource_group_name=cdktf.Token.as_string(azurerm_resource_group_example.name),
            route=[RouteTableRoute(
                address_prefix="10.1.0.0/16",
                name="route1",
                next_hop_type="VnetLocal"
            )
            ],
            tags={
                "environment": "Production"
            }
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        azurerm_route_table_example.override_logical_id("example")
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the route table. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. 

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to create the route table. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) Specifies the supported Azure location where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `route` - (Optional) [List of objects](/docs/configuration/attr-as-blocks.html) representing routes. Each object accepts the arguments documented below.

-> **NOTE** Since `route` can be configured both inline and via the separate `azurerm_route` resource, we have to explicitly set it to empty slice (`[]`) to remove it.

* `disable_bgp_route_propagation` - (Optional) Boolean flag which controls propagation of routes learned by BGP on that route table. True means disable.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

---

A `route` block support:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the route.

* `address_prefix` - (Required) The destination to which the route applies. Can be CIDR (such as `10.1.0.0/16`) or [Azure Service Tag](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview) (such as `ApiManagement`, `AzureBackup` or `AzureMonitor`) format.

* `next_hop_type` - (Required) The type of Azure hop the packet should be sent to. Possible values are `VirtualNetworkGateway`, `VnetLocal`, `Internet`, `VirtualAppliance` and `None`.

* `next_hop_in_ip_address` - (Optional) Contains the IP address packets should be forwarded to. Next hop values are only allowed in routes where the next hop type is `VirtualAppliance`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The Route Table ID.
* `subnets` - The collection of Subnets associated with this route table.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Route Table.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Route Table.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Route Table.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Route Table.

## Import

Route Tables can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_route_table.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.Network/routeTables/mytable1
```
