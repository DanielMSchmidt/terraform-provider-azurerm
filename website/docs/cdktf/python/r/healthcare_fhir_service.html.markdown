# azurerm_healthcare_fhir_service

Manages a Healthcare FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) Service

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.azurerm as azurerm
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        azurerm_resource_group_example = azurerm.resource_group.ResourceGroup(self, "example",
            location="West Europe",
            name="example"
        )
        data_azurerm_client_config_current =
        azurerm.data_azurerm_client_config.DataAzurermClientConfig(self, "current")
        azurerm_healthcare_workspace_example =

            resource_group_name=cdktf.Token.as_string(azurerm_resource_group_example.name)
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Healthcare FHIR Service. Changing this forces a new Healthcare FHIR Service to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Resource Group in which to create the Healthcare FHIR Service. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `workspace_id` - (Required) Specifies the id of the Healthcare Workspace where the Healthcare FHIR Service should exist. Changing this forces a new Healthcare FHIR Service to be created.

* `location` - (Required) Specifies the Azure Region where the Healthcare FHIR Service should be created. Changing this forces a new Healthcare FHIR Service to be created.

* `kind` - (Optional) Specifies the kind of the Healthcare FHIR Service. Possible values are: `fhir-Stu3` and `fhir-R4`. Defaults to `fhir-R4`. Changing this forces a new Healthcare FHIR Service to be created.

* `identity` - (Optional) An `identity` block as defined below.

* `access_policy_object_ids` - (Optional) A list of the access policies of the service instance.

* `cors` - (Optional) A `cors` block as defined below.

---
An `authentication` block supports the following:

* `authority` - (Required) The Azure Active Directory (tenant) that serves as the authentication authority to access the service. The default authority is the Directory defined in the authentication scheme in use when running Terraform.
  Authority must be registered to Azure AD and in the following format: <https://{Azure-AD-endpoint}/{tenant-id>}.
* `audience` - (Required) The intended audience to receive authentication tokens for the service. The default value is `https://<name>.fhir.azurehealthcareapis.com`.
* `smart_proxy_enabled` - (Optional) Whether smart proxy is enabled.

---

A `oci_artifact` block supports the following:

* `login_server` - (Required) An Azure container registry used for export operations of the service instance.

* `image_name` - (Optional) An image within Azure container registry used for export operations of the service instance.

* `digest` - (Optional) A digest of an image within Azure container registry used for export operations of the service instance to narrow the artifacts down.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Healthcare FHIR Service.

* `public_network_access_enabled` - Whether public networks access is enabled.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 90 minutes) Used when creating the Healthcare FHIR Service.
* `update` - (Defaults to 90 minutes) Used when updating the Healthcare FHIR Service.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Healthcare FHIR Service.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Healthcare FHIR Service.

## Import

Healthcare FHIR Service can be imported using the resource`id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_healthcare_fhir_service.example /subscriptions/12345678-1234-9876-4563-123456789012/resourceGroups/group1/providers/Microsoft.HealthcareApis/workspaces/workspace1/fhirServices/service1
