# azurerm_site_recovery_hyperv_replication_policy

Manages a Azure Site Recovery replication policy for HyperV within a Recovery Vault. Replication policies define the frequency at which recovery points are created and how long they are stored.

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.azurerm as azurerm
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        azurerm_resource_group_example = azurerm.resource_group.ResourceGroup(self, "example",
            location="East US",
            name="example-rg"
        )
        azurerm_recovery_services_vault_vault =
        azurerm.recovery_services_vault.RecoveryServicesVault(self, "vault",
            location=cdktf.Token.as_string(azurerm_resource_group_example.location),
            name="example-recovery-vault",
            resource_group_name=cdktf.Token.as_string(azurerm_resource_group_example.name),
            sku="Standard"
        )
        azurerm.site_recovery_hyperv_replication_policy.SiteRecoveryHypervReplicationPolicy(self, "policy",
            application_consistent_snapshot_frequency_in_hours=1,
            name="policy",
            recovery_point_retention_in_hours=2,
            recovery_vault_id=cdktf.Token.as_string(azurerm_recovery_services_vault_vault.id),
            replication_interval_in_seconds=300
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the replication policy. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) Name of the resource group where the vault that should be updated is located. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `recovery_vault_name` - (Required) The name of the vault that should be updated. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `recovery_point_retention_in_hours` - (Required) The duration in hours for which the recovery points need to be stored.

* `application_consistent_snapshot_frequency_in_hours` - (Required) Specifies the frequency at which to create application consistent recovery points.

* `replication_interval_in_seconds` - (Required) Specifies how frequently data should be synchronized between source and target locations. Possible values are `30` and `300`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Site Recovery Replication Policy.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Site Recovery Replication Policy.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Site Recovery Replication Policy.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Site Recovery Replication Policy.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Site Recovery Replication Policy.

## Import

Site Recovery Replication Policies can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_site_recovery_hyperv_replication_policy.mypolicy /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/resource-group-name/providers/Microsoft.RecoveryServices/vaults/recovery-vault-name/replicationPolicies/policy-name
```
