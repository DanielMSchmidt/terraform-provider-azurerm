# azurerm_cognitive_deployment

Manages a Cognitive Services Account Deployment.

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.azurerm as azurerm
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        azurerm_resource_group_example = azurerm.resource_group.ResourceGroup(self, "example",
            location="West Europe",
            name="example-resources"
        )
        azurerm_cognitive_account_example =
        azurerm.cognitive_account.CognitiveAccount(self, "example_1",
            kind="OpenAI",
            location=cdktf.Token.as_string(azurerm_resource_group_example.location),
            name="example-ca",
            resource_group_name=cdktf.Token.as_string(azurerm_resource_group_example.name),
            sku_name="S0"
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        azurerm_cognitive_account_example.override_logical_id("example")
        azurerm_cognitive_deployment_example =
        azurerm.cognitive_deployment.CognitiveDeployment(self, "example_2",
            cognitive_account_id=cdktf.Token.as_string(azurerm_cognitive_account_example.id),
            model=CognitiveDeploymentModel(
                format="OpenAI",
                name="text-curie-001",
                version="1"
            ),
            name="example-cd",
            scale=CognitiveDeploymentScale(
                type="Standard"
            )
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        azurerm_cognitive_deployment_example.override_logical_id("example")
```
