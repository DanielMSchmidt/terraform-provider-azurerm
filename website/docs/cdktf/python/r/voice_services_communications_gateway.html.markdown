!> **NOTE:** Access to Azure Communications Gateway is restricted, see [`Get access to Azure Communications Gateway for your Azure subscription`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communications-gateway/prepare-to-deploy#9-get-access-to-azure-communications-gateway-for-your-azure-subscription) for details.

## Example Usage

```python

## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name which should be used for this Voice Services Communications Gateways. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) Specifies the Azure Region where the Voice Services Communications Gateways should exist. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Resource Group where the Voice Services Communications Gateways should exist. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `connectivity` - (Required) How to connect back to the operator network, e.g. MAPS. Possible values is `PublicAddress`. Changing this forces a new Voice Services Communications Gateways to be created.

* `codecs` - (Required) The voice codecs expected for communication with Teams. Possible values are `PCMA`, `PCMU`,`G722`,`G722_2`,`SILK_8` and `SILK_16`.

* `e911_type` - (Required) How to handle 911 calls. Possible values are `Standard` and `DirectToEsrp`.

* `platforms` - (Required) The Voice Services Communications GatewaysAvailable supports platform types. Possible values are `OperatorConnect`, `TeamsPhoneMobile`.

* `service_location` - (Required) A `service_location` block as defined below.

* `auto_generated_domain_name_label_scope` - (Optional) Specifies the scope at which the auto-generated domain name can be re-used. Possible values are `TenantReuse`, `SubscriptionReuse`, `ResourceGroupReuse` and `NoReuse` . Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `api_bridge` - (Optional) Details of API bridge functionality, if required.

* `emergency_dial_strings` - (Optional) A list of dial strings used for emergency calling.

* `on_prem_mcp_enabled` - (Optional) Whether an on-premises Mobile Control Point is in use.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags which should be assigned to the Voice Services Communications Gateways.

* `microsoft_teams_voicemail_pilot_number` - (Optional) This number is used in Teams Phone Mobile scenarios for access to the voicemail IVR from the native dialer.
---

A `service_location` block supports the following:

* `location` - (Required) Specifies the region in which the resources needed for Teams Calling will be deployed.

* `operator_addresses` - (Required) IP address to use to contact the operator network from this region.

* `allowed_media_source_address_prefixes` - (Optional) Specifies the allowed source IP address or CIDR ranges for media.

* `allowed_signaling_source_address_prefixes` - (Optional) Specifies the allowed source IP address or CIDR ranges for signaling.

* `esrp_addresses` - (Optional) IP address to use to contact the ESRP from this region.

!> **NOTE:** The `esrp_addresses` must be specified for each `service_location` when the`e911_type` is set to `DirectToEsrp`.  The `esrp_addresses` must not be specified for each `service_location` when the`e911_type` is set to `Standard`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Voice Services Communications Gateways.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Voice Services Communications Gateways.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Voice Services Communications Gateways.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Voice Services Communications Gateways.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Voice Services Communications Gateways.

## Import

Voice Services Communications Gateways can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.
