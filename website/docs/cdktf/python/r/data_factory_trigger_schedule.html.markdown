# azurerm_data_factory_trigger_schedule

Manages a Trigger Schedule inside a Azure Data Factory.

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.azurerm as azurerm
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        azurerm_resource_group_example = azurerm.resource_group.ResourceGroup(self, "example",
            location="West Europe",
            name="example-resources"
        )
        azurerm_data_factory_example = azurerm.data_factory.DataFactory(self, "example_1",
            location=cdktf.Token.as_string(azurerm_resource_group_example.location),
            name="example",
            resource_group_name=cdktf.Token.as_string(azurerm_resource_group_example.name)
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        azurerm_data_factory_example.override_logical_id("example")
        azurerm_data_factory_pipeline_example =
        azurerm.data_factory_pipeline.DataFactoryPipeline(self, "example_2",
            data_factory_id=cdktf.Token.as_string(azurerm_data_factory_example.id),
            name="example"
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        azurerm_data_factory_pipeline_example.override_logical_id("example")
        azurerm_data_factory_trigger_schedule_example =
        azurerm.data_factory_trigger_schedule.DataFactoryTriggerSchedule(self, "example_3",
            data_factory_id=cdktf.Token.as_string(azurerm_data_factory_example.id),
            frequency="Day",
            interval=5,
            name="example",
            pipeline_name=cdktf.Token.as_string(azurerm_data_factory_pipeline_example.name)
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        azurerm_data_factory_trigger_schedule_example.override_logical_id("example")
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Data Factory Schedule Trigger. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. Must be globally unique. See the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/naming-rules) for all restrictions.

* `data_factory_id` - (Required) The Data Factory ID in which to associate the Linked Service with. Changing this forces a new resource.

* `description` - (Optional) The Schedule Trigger's description.

* `schedule` - (Optional) A `schedule` block as defined below, which further specifies the recurrence schedule for the trigger. A schedule is capable of limiting or increasing the number of trigger executions specified by the `frequency` and `interval` properties.

* `start_time` - (Optional) The time the Schedule Trigger will start. This defaults to the current time. The time will be represented in UTC.

* `time_zone` - (Optional) The timezone of the start/end time.

* `end_time` - (Optional) The time the Schedule Trigger should end. The time will be represented in UTC.

* `interval` - (Optional) The interval for how often the trigger occurs. This defaults to `1`.

* `frequency` - (Optional) The trigger frequency. Valid values include `Minute`, `Hour`, `Day`, `Week`, `Month`. Defaults to `Minute`.

* `activated` - (Optional) Specifies if the Data Factory Schedule Trigger is activated. Defaults to `true`.

* `pipeline` - (Optional) block as defined below.

* `pipeline_name` - (Optional) The Data Factory Pipeline name that the trigger will act on.

* `pipeline_parameters` - (Optional) The pipeline parameters that the trigger will act upon.

* `annotations` - (Optional) List of tags that can be used for describing the Data Factory Schedule Trigger.

---

A `schedule` block supports the following:

* `days_of_month` - (Optional) Day(s) of the month on which the trigger is scheduled. This value can be specified with a monthly frequency only.

* `days_of_week` - (Optional) Days of the week on which the trigger is scheduled. This value can be specified only with a weekly frequency.

* `hours` - (Optional) Hours of the day on which the trigger is scheduled.

* `minutes` - (Optional) Minutes of the hour on which the trigger is scheduled.

* `monthly` - (Optional) A `monthly` block as documented below, which specifies the days of the month on which the trigger is scheduled. The value can be specified only with a monthly frequency.

---

A `monthly` block supports the following:

* `weekday` - (Required) The day of the week on which the trigger runs. For example, a `monthly` property with a `weekday` value of `Sunday` means every Sunday of the month.

* `week` - (Optional) The occurrence of the specified day during the month. For example, a `monthly` property with `weekday` and `week` values of `Sunday, -1` means the last Sunday of the month.

---

A `pipeline` block supports the following:

* `name` - (Required) Reference pipeline name.

* `parameters` - (Optional) The pipeline parameters that the trigger will act upon.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Data Factory Schedule Trigger.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Data Factory Schedule Trigger.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Data Factory Schedule Trigger.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Data Factory Schedule Trigger.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Data Factory Schedule Trigger.

## Import

Data Factory Schedule Trigger can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_data_factory_trigger_schedule.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/example/providers/Microsoft.DataFactory/factories/example/triggers/example
```
