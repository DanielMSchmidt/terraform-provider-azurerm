# azurerm_logic_app_integration_account_batch_configuration

Manages a Logic App Integration Account Batch Configuration.

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.azurerm as azurerm
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        azurerm_resource_group_example = azurerm.resource_group.ResourceGroup(self, "example",
            location="West Europe",
            name="example-resources"
        )
        azurerm_logic_app_integration_account_example =
        azurerm.logic_app_integration_account.LogicAppIntegrationAccount(self, "example_1",
            location=cdktf.Token.as_string(azurerm_resource_group_example.location),
            name="example-ia",
            resource_group_name=cdktf.Token.as_string(azurerm_resource_group_example.name),
            sku_name="Standard"
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        azurerm_logic_app_integration_account_example.override_logical_id("example")
        azurerm_logic_app_integration_account_batch_configuration_example =
        azurerm.logic_app_integration_account_batch_configuration.LogicAppIntegrationAccountBatchConfiguration(self, "example_2",
            batch_group_name="TestBatchGroup",
            integration_account_name=cdktf.Token.as_string(azurerm_logic_app_integration_account_example.name),
            name="exampleiabc",
            release_criteria=LogicAppIntegrationAccountBatchConfigurationReleaseCriteria(
                message_count=80
            ),
            resource_group_name=cdktf.Token.as_string(azurerm_resource_group_example.name)
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        azurerm_logic_app_integration_account_batch_configuration_example.override_logical_id("example")
