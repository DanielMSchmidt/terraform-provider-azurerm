# azurerm_databricks_access_connector

Manages a Databricks Access Connector

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.azurerm as azurerm
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        azurerm_resource_group_example = azurerm.resource_group.ResourceGroup(self, "example",
            location="West Europe",
            name="example-resources"
        )
        azurerm_databricks_access_connector_example =
        azurerm.databricks_access_connector.DatabricksAccessConnector(self, "example_1",
            identity=DatabricksAccessConnectorIdentity(
                type="SystemAssigned"
            ),
            location=cdktf.Token.as_string(azurerm_resource_group_example.location),
            name="example-resource",
            resource_group_name=cdktf.Token.as_string(azurerm_resource_group_example.name),
            tags={
                "Environment": "Production"
            }
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        azurerm_databricks_access_connector_example.override_logical_id("example")
```

## Argument Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Databricks Access Connector resource. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the Resource Group in which the Databricks Access Connector should exist. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) Specifies the supported Azure location where the resource has to be created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `identity` - (Optional) An `identity` block as defined below.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

---

An `identity` block supports the following:

* `type` - (Required) Specifies the type of Managed Service Identity that should be configured on the Databricks Access Connector. Possible values include `SystemAssigned` or `UserAssigned`.

* `identity_ids` - (Optional) Specifies a list of User Assigned Managed Identity IDs to be assigned to the Databricks Access Connector. Only one User Assigned Managed Identity ID is supported per Databricks Access Connector resource.

~> **NOTE:** `identity_ids` are required when `type` is set to `UserAssigned`.

---

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Databricks Access Connector in the Azure management plane.

* `identity` - A list of `identity` blocks containing the system-assigned managed identities as defined below.

---

An `identity` block exports the following:

* `type` - (Required) The type of Managed Service Identity that is configured on this Access Connector.

* `principal_id` - The Principal ID of the System Assigned Managed Service Identity that is configured on this Access Connector.

* `tenant_id` - The Tenant ID of the System Assigned Managed Service Identity that is configured on this Access Connector.

* `identity_ids` - (Optional) The list of User Assigned Managed Identity IDs assigned to this Access Connector. 


## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Databricks Access Connector.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Databricks Access Connector.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Databricks Access Connector.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Databricks Access Connector.

## Import

Databricks Access Connectors can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_databricks_access_connector.connector1 /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/group1/providers/Microsoft.Databricks/accessConnectors/connector1
