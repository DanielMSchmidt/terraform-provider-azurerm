# azurerm_iothub_dps_shared_access_policy

Manages an IotHub Device Provisioning Service Shared Access Policy

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.azurerm as azurerm
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        azurerm_resource_group_example = azurerm.resource_group.ResourceGroup(self, "example",
            location="West Europe",
            name="example-resources"
        )
        azurerm_iothub_dps_example = azurerm.iothub_dps.IothubDps(self, "example_1",
            location=cdktf.Token.as_string(azurerm_resource_group_example.location),
            name="example",
            resource_group_name=cdktf.Token.as_string(azurerm_resource_group_example.name),
            sku=IothubDpsSku(
                capacity=cdktf.Token.as_number("1"),
                name="S1"
            )
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        azurerm_iothub_dps_example.override_logical_id("example")
        azurerm_iothub_dps_shared_access_policy_example =
        azurerm.iothub_dps_shared_access_policy.IothubDpsSharedAccessPolicy(self, "example_2",
            enrollment_read=True,
            enrollment_write=True,
            iothub_dps_name=cdktf.Token.as_string(azurerm_iothub_dps_example.name),
            name="example",
            resource_group_name=cdktf.Token.as_string(azurerm_resource_group_example.name)
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        azurerm_iothub_dps_shared_access_policy_example.override_logical_id("example")
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the IotHub Shared Access Policy resource. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group under which the IotHub Shared Access Policy resource has to be created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `iothub_dps_name` - (Required) The name of the IoT Hub Device Provisioning service to which this Shared Access Policy belongs. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `enrollment_read` - (Optional) Adds `EnrollmentRead` permission to this Shared Access Account. It allows read access to enrollment data.

-> **NOTE** When `enrollment_read` is set to `true`, `registration_read` must also be set to true. This is a limitation of the Azure REST API

* `enrollment_write` - (Optional) Adds `EnrollmentWrite` permission to this Shared Access Account. It allows write access to enrollment data.

-> **NOTE** When `registration_write` is set to `true`, `enrollment_read`, `registration_read`, and `registration_write` must also be set to true. This is a requirement of the Azure API.

* `registration_read` - (Optional) Adds `RegistrationStatusRead` permission to this Shared Access Account. It allows read access to device registrations.

* `registration_write` - (Optional) Adds `RegistrationStatusWrite` permission to this Shared Access Account. It allows write access to device registrations.

-> **NOTE** When `registration_write` is set to `true`, `registration_read` must also be set to true. This is a requirement of the Azure API.

* `service_config` - (Optional) Adds `ServiceConfig` permission to this Shared Access Account. It allows configuration of the Device Provisioning Service.

-> **NOTE** At least one of `registration_read`, `registration_write`, `service_config`, `enrollment_read`, `enrollment_write` permissions must be set to `true`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the IoTHub Device Provisioning Service Shared Access Policy.

* `primary_key` - The primary key used to create the authentication token.

* `primary_connection_string` - The primary connection string of the Shared Access Policy.

* `secondary_key` - The secondary key used to create the authentication token.

* `secondary_connection_string` - The secondary connection string of the Shared Access Policy.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the IotHub Device Provisioning Service Shared Access Policy.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the IotHub Device Provisioning Service Shared Access Policy.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the IotHub Device Provisioning Service Shared Access Policy.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the IotHub Device Provisioning Service Shared Access Policy.

## Import

IoTHub Device Provisioning Service Shared Access Policies can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_iothub_dps_shared_access_policy.shared_access_policy1 /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.Devices/provisioningServices/dps1/keys/shared_access_policy1
```
