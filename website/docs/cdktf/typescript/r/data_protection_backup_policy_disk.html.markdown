# azurerm_data_protection_backup_policy_disk

Manages a Backup Policy Disk.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
      this,
      "example",
      {
        location: "West Europe",
        name: "example-resources",
      }
    );
    const azurermDataProtectionBackupVaultExample =
      new azurerm.dataProtectionBackupVault.DataProtectionBackupVault(
        this,
        "example_1",
        {
          datastoreType: "VaultStore",
          location: cdktf.Token.asString(azurermResourceGroupExample.location),
          name: "example-backup-vault",
          redundancy: "LocallyRedundant",
          resourceGroupName: cdktf.Token.asString(
            azurermResourceGroupExample.name
          ),
        }
      );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    azurermDataProtectionBackupVaultExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
    const azurermDataProtectionBackupPolicyDiskExample =
      new azurerm.dataProtectionBackupPolicyDisk.DataProtectionBackupPolicyDisk(
        this,
        "example_2",
        {
          backupRepeatingTimeIntervals: ["R/2021-05-19T06:33:16+00:00/PT4H"],
          defaultRetentionDuration: "P7D",
          name: "example-backup-policy",
          retentionRule: [
            {
              criteria: {
                absoluteCriteria: "FirstOfDay",
              },
              duration: "P7D",
              name: "Daily",
              priority: 25,
            },
            {
              criteria: {
                absoluteCriteria: "FirstOfWeek",
              },
              duration: "P7D",
              name: "Weekly",
              priority: 20,
            },
          ],
          vaultId: cdktf.Token.asString(
            azurermDataProtectionBackupVaultExample.id
          ),
        }
      );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    azurermDataProtectionBackupPolicyDiskExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name which should be used for this Backup Policy Disk. Changing this forces a new Backup Policy Disk to be created.

* `vaultId` - (Required) The ID of the Backup Vault within which the Backup Policy Disk should exist. Changing this forces a new Backup Policy Disk to be created.

* `backupRepeatingTimeIntervals` - (Required) Specifies a list of repeating time interval. It should follow `ISO 8601` repeating time interval . Changing this forces a new Backup Policy Disk to be created.

* `defaultRetentionDuration` - (Required) The duration of default retention rule. It should follow `ISO 8601` duration format. Changing this forces a new Backup Policy Disk to be created.

---

* `retentionRule` - (Optional) One or more `retentionRule` blocks as defined below. Changing this forces a new Backup Policy Disk to be created.

---

A `retentionRule` block supports the following:

* `name` - (Required) The name which should be used for this retention rule. Changing this forces a new Backup Policy Disk to be created.

* `duration` - (Required) Duration of deletion after given timespan. It should follow `ISO 8601` duration format. Changing this forces a new Backup Policy Disk to be created.

* `criteria` - (Required) A `criteria` block as defined below. Changing this forces a new Backup Policy Disk to be created.

* `priority` - (Required) Retention Tag priority. Changing this forces a new Backup Policy Disk to be created.

---

A `criteria` block supports the following:

* `absoluteCriteria` - (Optional) Possible values are `firstOfDay` and `firstOfWeek`. Changing this forces a new Backup Policy Disk to be created.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Backup Policy Disk.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Backup Policy Disk.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Backup Policy Disk.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Backup Policy Disk.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Backup Policy Disk.

## Import

Backup Policy Disks can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_data_protection_backup_policy_disk.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/group1/providers/Microsoft.DataProtection/backupVaults/vault1/backupPolicies/backupPolicy1
```
