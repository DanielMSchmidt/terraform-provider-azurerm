Manages a Monitor Action Rule which type is suppression.

!> **NOTE:** This resource has been deprecated in version 3.0 of the AzureRM provider and will be removed in version 4.0. Please use [`azurermMonitorAlertProcessingRuleSuppression`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/monitor_alert_processing_rule_suppression) resource instead.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
      this,
      "example",
      {
        location: "West Europe",
        name: "example-resources",
      }
    );
    const azurermMonitorActionRuleSuppressionExample =
      new azurerm.monitorActionRuleSuppression.MonitorActionRuleSuppression(
        this,
        "example_1",
        {
          name: "example-amar",
          resourceGroupName: cdktf.Token.asString(
            azurermResourceGroupExample.name
          ),
          scope: {
            resourceIds: [cdktf.Token.asString(azurermResourceGroupExample.id)],
            type: "ResourceGroup",
          },
          suppression: {
            recurrenceType: "Weekly",
            schedule: {
              endDateUtc: "2019-01-03T15:02:07Z",
              recurrenceWeekly: ["Sunday", "Monday", "Friday", "Saturday"],
              startDateUtc: "2019-01-01T01:02:03Z",
            },
          },
          tags: {
            foo: "bar",
          },
        }
      );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    azurermMonitorActionRuleSuppressionExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}
