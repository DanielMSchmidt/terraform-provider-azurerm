/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const dataAzurermSubscriptionPrimary =
      new azurerm.dataAzurermSubscription.DataAzurermSubscription(
        this,
        "primary",
        {}
      );
    new azurerm.lighthouseAssignment.LighthouseAssignment(this, "example", {
      lighthouseDefinitionId:
        "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/providers/Microsoft.ManagedServices/registrationDefinitions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",

    });
  }
}

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Optional) A unique UUID/GUID which identifies this lighthouse assignment- one will be generated if not specified. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `scope` - (Required) The scope at which the Lighthouse Assignment applies too, such as `/subscriptions/0B1F64711Bf04DdaAec3111122223333` or `/subscriptions/0B1F64711Bf04DdaAec3111122223333/resourceGroups/myGroup`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `lighthouseDefinitionId` - (Required) A Fully qualified path of the lighthouse definition, such as `/subscriptions/0Afefe50734E46108C82A144Aff49Dea/providers/microsoftManagedServices/registrationDefinitions/26C128C2Fefa43409Bb18E081C90Ada2`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - the fully qualified ID of the Lighthouse Assignment.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Lighthouse Assignment.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Lighthouse Assignment.
