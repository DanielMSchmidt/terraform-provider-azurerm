```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
      this,
      "example",
      {
        location: "West Europe",
        name: "example-resources",
      }
    );
    const azurermApiManagementExample = new azurerm.apiManagement.ApiManagement(
      this,
      "example_1",
      {
        location: cdktf.Token.asString(azurermResourceGroupExample.location),
        name: "example-apim",
        publisherEmail: "company@terraform.io",
        publisherName: "My Company",
        resourceGroupName: cdktf.Token.asString(
          azurermResourceGroupExample.name
        ),
        skuName: "Developer_1",
      }
    );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    azurermApiManagementExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
    const azurermApiManagementProductExample =
      new azurerm.apiManagementProduct.ApiManagementProduct(this, "example_2", {
        apiManagementName: cdktf.Token.asString(
          azurermApiManagementExample.name
        ),
        approvalRequired: true,
        displayName: "Test Product",
        productId: "test-product",
        published: true,
        resourceGroupName: cdktf.Token.asString(
          azurermResourceGroupExample.name
        ),
        subscriptionRequired: true,
      });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    azurermApiManagementProductExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
