# azurerm_cosmosdb_sql_container

Manages a SQL Container within a Cosmos DB Account.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const dataAzurermCosmosdbAccountExample =
      new azurerm.dataAzurermCosmosdbAccount.DataAzurermCosmosdbAccount(
        this,
        "example",
        {
          name: "tfex-cosmosdb-account",
          resourceGroupName: "tfex-cosmosdb-account-rg",
        }
      );
    const azurermCosmosdbSqlDatabaseExample =
      new azurerm.cosmosdbSqlDatabase.CosmosdbSqlDatabase(this, "example_1", {
        accountName: cdktf.Token.asString(
          dataAzurermCosmosdbAccountExample.name
        ),
        name: "example-acsd",
        resourceGroupName: cdktf.Token.asString(
          dataAzurermCosmosdbAccountExample.resourceGroupName
        ),
      });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    azurermCosmosdbSqlDatabaseExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
    const azurermCosmosdbSqlContainerExample =
      new azurerm.cosmosdbSqlContainer.CosmosdbSqlContainer(this, "example_2", {
        accountName: cdktf.Token.asString(
          dataAzurermCosmosdbAccountExample.name
        ),
        databaseName: cdktf.Token.asString(
          azurermCosmosdbSqlDatabaseExample.name
        ),
        indexingPolicy: {
          excludedPath: [
            {
              path: "/excluded/?",
            },
          ],

            {
              path: "/included/?",
            },
          ],
          indexingMode: "consistent",
        },
        name: "example-container",
        partitionKeyPath: "/definition/id",
        partitionKeyVersion: 1,
        resourceGroupName: cdktf.Token.asString(
          dataAzurermCosmosdbAccountExample.resourceGroupName
        ),
        throughput: 400,
        uniqueKey: [
          {
            paths: ["/definition/idlong", "/definition/idshort"],
          },
        ],
      });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    azurermCosmosdbSqlContainerExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Cosmos DB SQL Container. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resourceGroupName` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which the Cosmos DB SQL Container is created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `accountName` - (Required) The name of the Cosmos DB Account to create the container within. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `databaseName` - (Required) The name of the Cosmos DB SQL Database to create the container within. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `partitionKeyPath` - (Required) Define a partition key. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `partitionKeyVersion` - (Optional) Define a partition key version. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. Possible values are `1`and `2`. This should be set to `2` in order to use large partition keys.

* `uniqueKey` - (Optional) One or more `uniqueKey` blocks as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `throughput` - (Optional) The throughput of SQL container (RU/s). Must be set in increments of `100`. The minimum value is `400`. This must be set upon container creation otherwise it cannot be updated without a manual terraform destroy-apply.

* `autoscaleSettings` - (Optional) An `autoscaleSettings` block as defined below. This must be set upon database creation otherwise it cannot be updated without a manual terraform destroy-apply. Requires `partitionKeyPath` to be set.

~> **Note:** Switching between autoscale and manual throughput is not supported via Terraform and must be completed via the Azure Portal and refreshed.

* `indexingPolicy` - (Optional) An `indexingPolicy` block as defined below.

* `defaultTtl` - (Optional) The default time to live of SQL container. If missing, items are not expired automatically. If present and the value is set to `1`, it is equal to infinity, and items don’t expire by default. If present and the value is set to some number `n` – items will expire `n` seconds after their last modified time.

* `analyticalStorageTtl` - (Optional) The default time to live of Analytical Storage for this SQL container. If present and the value is set to `1`, it is equal to infinity, and items don’t expire by default. If present and the value is set to some number `n` – items will expire `n` seconds after their last modified time.

* `conflictResolutionPolicy` - (Optional) A `conflictResolutionPolicy` blocks as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

---

An `autoscaleSettings` block supports the following:

* `maxThroughput` - (Optional) The maximum throughput of the SQL container (RU/s). Must be between `1,000` and `1,000,000`. Must be set in increments of `1,000`. Conflicts with `throughput`.

---
A `uniqueKey` block supports the following:

* `paths` - (Required) A list of paths to use for this unique key. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

---
An `indexingPolicy` block supports the following:

* `indexingMode` - (Optional) Indicates the indexing mode. Possible values include: `consistent` and `none`. Defaults to `consistent`.

* `includedPath` - (Optional) One or more `includedPath` blocks as defined below. Either `includedPath` or `excludedPath` must contain the `path` `/*`

* `excludedPath` - (Optional) One or more `excludedPath` blocks as defined below. Either `includedPath` or `excludedPath` must contain the `path` `/*`

* `compositeIndex` - (Optional) One or more `compositeIndex` blocks as defined below.

* `spatialIndex` - (Optional) One or more `spatialIndex` blocks as defined below.

---

A `spatialIndex` block supports the following:

* `path` - (Required) Path for which the indexing behaviour applies to. According to the service design, all spatial types including `lineString`, `multiPolygon`, `point`, and `polygon` will be applied to the path.

---

An `includedPath` block supports the following:

* `path` - (Required) Path for which the indexing behaviour applies to.

---

An `excludedPath` block supports the following:

* `path` - (Required) Path that is excluded from indexing.

---

A `compositeIndex` block supports the following:

* `index` - (Required) One or more `index` blocks as defined below.

---

An `index` block supports the following:

* `path` - (Required) Path for which the indexing behaviour applies to.

* `order` - (Required) Order of the index. Possible values are `ascending` or `descending`.

---

A `conflictResolutionPolicy` block supports the following:

* `mode` - (Required) Indicates the conflict resolution mode. Possible values include: `lastWriterWins`, `custom`.

* `conflictResolutionPath` - (Optional) The conflict resolution path in the case of `lastWriterWins` mode.

* `conflictResolutionProcedure` - (Optional) The procedure to resolve conflicts in the case of `custom` mode.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the CosmosDB SQL Container.

---

A `spatialIndex` block exports the following:

* `types` - A set of spatial types of the path.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the CosmosDB SQL Container.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the CosmosDB SQL Container.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the CosmosDB SQL Container.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the CosmosDB SQL Container.

## Import

Cosmos SQL Containers can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_cosmosdb_sql_container.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/group1/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/account1/sqlDatabases/database1/containers/container1
```
