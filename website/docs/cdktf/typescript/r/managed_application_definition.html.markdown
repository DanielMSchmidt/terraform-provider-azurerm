# azurerm_managed_application_definition

Manages a Managed Application Definition.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new azurerm.provider.AzurermProvider(this, "azurerm", {
      features: {},
    });
    const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
      this,
      "example",
      {
        location: "West Europe",
        name: "example-resources",
      }
    );
    const dataAzurermClientConfigCurrent =
      new azurerm.dataAzurermClientConfig.DataAzurermClientConfig(
        this,
        "current",
        {}
      );
    const azurermManagedApplicationDefinitionExample =
      new azurerm.managedApplicationDefinition.ManagedApplicationDefinition(
        this,
        "example_3",
        {
          authorization: [
            {
              roleDefinitionId: "a094b430-dad3-424d-ae58-13f72fd72591",
              servicePrincipalId: cdktf.Token.asString(
                dataAzurermClientConfigCurrent.objectId
              ),
            },
          ],
          description: "Test Managed Application Definition",
          displayName: "TestManagedApplicationDefinition",
          location: cdktf.Token.asString(azurermResourceGroupExample.location),
          lockLevel: "ReadOnly",
          name: "examplemanagedapplicationdefinition",
          packageFileUri:
            "https://github.com/Azure/azure-managedapp-samples/raw/master/Managed Application Sample Packages/201-managed-storage-account/managedstorage.zip",
          resourceGroupName: cdktf.Token.asString(
            azurermResourceGroupExample.name
          ),
        }
      );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    azurermManagedApplicationDefinitionExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Managed Application Definition. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resourceGroupName` - (Required) The name of the Resource Group where the Managed Application Definition should exist. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) Specifies the supported Azure location where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `lockLevel` - (Required) Specifies the managed application lock level. Valid values include `canNotDelete`, `none`, `readOnly`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `authorization` - (Optional) One or more `authorization` block defined below.

* `createUiDefinition` - (Optional) Specifies the `createUiDefinition` JSON for the backing template with `microsoftSolutions/applications` resource.

* `displayName` - (Required) Specifies the managed application definition display name.

* `description` - (Optional) Specifies the managed application definition description.

* `packageEnabled` - (Optional) Is the package enabled? Defaults to `true`.

* `mainTemplate` - (Optional) Specifies the inline main template JSON which has resources to be provisioned.

* `packageFileUri` - (Optional) Specifies the managed application definition package file Uri.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

-> **NOTE:** If either `createUiDefinition` or `mainTemplate` is set they both must be set.

---

An `authorization` block supports the following:

* `roleDefinitionId` - (Required) Specifies a role definition identifier for the provider. This role will define all the permissions that the provider must have on the managed application's container resource group. This role definition cannot have permission to delete the resource group.

* `servicePrincipalId` - (Required) Specifies a service principal identifier for the provider. This is the identity that the provider will use to call ARM to manage the managed application resources.

---

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Managed Application Definition.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Managed Application Definition.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Managed Application Definition.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Managed Application Definition.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Managed Application Definition.

## Import

Managed Application Definition can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_managed_application_definition.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/group1/providers/Microsoft.Solutions/applicationDefinitions/appDefinition1
