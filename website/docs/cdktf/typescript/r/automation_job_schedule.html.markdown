# azurerm_automation_job_schedule

Links an Automation Runbook and Schedule.

## Example Usage

This is an example of just the Job Schedule. A full example of the `azurermAutomationJobSchedule` resource can be found in [the `/examples/automationAccount` directory within the GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/tree/main/examples/automation-account)

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new azurerm.automationJobSchedule.AutomationJobSchedule(this, "example", {
      automationAccountName: "tf-automation-account",
      parameters: {
        resourcegroup: "tf-rgr-vm",
        vmname: "TF-VM-01",
      },
      resourceGroupName: "tf-rgr-automation",
      runbookName: "Get-VirtualMachine",
      scheduleName: "hour",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `resourceGroupName` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which the Job Schedule is created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `automationAccountName` - (Required) The name of the Automation Account in which the Job Schedule is created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `runbookName` - (Required) The name of a Runbook to link to a Schedule. It needs to be in the same Automation Account as the Schedule and Job Schedule. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `scheduleName` - (Required) The name of the Schedule. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `parameters` - (Optional) A map of key/value pairs corresponding to the arguments that can be passed to the Runbook. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

-> **NOTE:** The parameter keys/names must strictly be in lowercase, even if this is not the case in the runbook. This is due to a limitation in Azure Automation where the parameter names are normalized. The values specified don't have this limitation.

* `runOn` - (Optional) Name of a Hybrid Worker Group the Runbook will be executed on. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Automation Job Schedule.

* `jobScheduleId` - (Optional) The UUID identifying the Automation Job Schedule.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Automation Job Schedule.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Automation Job Schedule.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Automation Job Schedule.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Automation Job Schedule.

## Import
