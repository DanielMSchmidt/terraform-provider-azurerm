Manages a Databricks Access Connector

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
      this,
      "example",
      {
        location: "West Europe",
        name: "example-resources",
      }
    );
    const azurermDatabricksAccessConnectorExample =
      new azurerm.databricksAccessConnector.DatabricksAccessConnector(
        this,
        "example_1",
        {
          identity: {
            type: "SystemAssigned",
          },
          location: cdktf.Token.asString(azurermResourceGroupExample.location),
          name: "example-resource",
          resourceGroupName: cdktf.Token.asString(
            azurermResourceGroupExample.name
          ),
          tags: {
            Environment: "Production",
          },
        }
      );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    azurermDatabricksAccessConnectorExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Databricks Access Connector resource. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resourceGroupName` - (Required) The name of the Resource Group in which the Databricks Access Connector should exist. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) Specifies the supported Azure location where the resource has to be created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `identity` - (Optional) An `identity` block as defined below.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

---

An `identity` block supports the following:

* `type` - (Required) Specifies the type of Managed Service Identity that should be configured on the Databricks Access Connector. Possible values include `systemAssigned` or `userAssigned`.

* `identityIds` - (Optional) Specifies a list of User Assigned Managed Identity IDs to be assigned to the Databricks Access Connector. Only one User Assigned Managed Identity ID is supported per Databricks Access Connector resource.

~> **NOTE:** `identityIds` are required when `type` is set to `userAssigned`.

---

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Databricks Access Connector in the Azure management plane.

* `identity` - A list of `identity` blocks containing the system-assigned managed identities as defined below.

---

An `identity` block exports the following:

* `type` - (Required) The type of Managed Service Identity that is configured on this Access Connector.

* `principalId` - The Principal ID of the System Assigned Managed Service Identity that is configured on this Access Connector.

* `tenantId` - The Tenant ID of the System Assigned Managed Service Identity that is configured on this Access Connector.

* `identityIds` - (Optional) The list of User Assigned Managed Identity IDs assigned to this Access Connector. 


## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Databricks Access Connector.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Databricks Access Connector.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Databricks Access Connector.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Databricks Access Connector.

## Import

Databricks Access Connectors can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_databricks_access_connector.connector1 /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/group1/providers/Microsoft.Databricks/accessConnectors/connector1
