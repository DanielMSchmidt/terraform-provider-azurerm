# azurerm_logic_app_trigger_recurrence

Manages a Recurrence Trigger within a Logic App Workflow

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
      this,
      "example",
      {
        location: "West Europe",
        name: "workflow-resources",
      }
    );
    const azurermLogicAppWorkflowExample =
      new azurerm.logicAppWorkflow.LogicAppWorkflow(this, "example_1", {
        location: cdktf.Token.asString(azurermResourceGroupExample.location),
        name: "workflow1",
        resourceGroupName: cdktf.Token.asString(
          azurermResourceGroupExample.name
        ),
      });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    azurermLogicAppWorkflowExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
    const azurermLogicAppTriggerRecurrenceExample =
      new azurerm.logicAppTriggerRecurrence.LogicAppTriggerRecurrence(
        this,
        "example_2",
        {
          frequency: "Day",
          interval: 1,
          logicAppId: cdktf.Token.asString(azurermLogicAppWorkflowExample.id),
          name: "run-every-day",
        }
      );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    azurermLogicAppTriggerRecurrenceExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Recurrence Triggers to be created within the Logic App Workflow. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

-> **NOTE:** This name must be unique across all Triggers within the Logic App Workflow.

* `logicAppId` - (Required) Specifies the ID of the Logic App Workflow. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `frequency` - (Required) Specifies the Frequency at which this Trigger should be run. Possible values include `month`, `week`, `day`, `hour`, `minute` and `second`.

* `interval` - (Required) Specifies interval used for the Frequency, for example a value of `4` for `interval` and `hour` for `frequency` would run the Trigger every 4 hours.

* `startTime` - (Optional) Specifies the start date and time for this trigger in RFC3339 format: `20000102T03:04:05Z`.

* `timeZone` - (Optional) Specifies the time zone for this trigger. Supported time zone options are listed [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/973627/microsoft-time-zone-index-values)

* `schedule` - (Optional) A `schedule` block as specified below.

---

A `schedule` block supports the following:

* `atTheseMinutes` - (Optional) Specifies a list of minutes when the trigger should run. Valid values are between 0 and 59.

* `atTheseHours` - (Optional) Specifies a list of hours when the trigger should run. Valid values are between 0 and 23.

* `onTheseDays` - (Optional) Specifies a list of days when the trigger should run. Valid values include `monday`, `tuesday`, `wednesday`, `thursday`, `friday`, `saturday`, and `sunday`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Recurrence Trigger within the Logic App Workflow.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Logic App Recurrence Trigger.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Logic App Recurrence Trigger.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Logic App Recurrence Trigger.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Logic App Recurrence Trigger.

## Import

Logic App Recurrence Triggers can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_logic_app_trigger_recurrence.daily /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.Logic/workflows/workflow1/triggers/daily
```

-> **NOTE:** This ID is unique to Terraform and doesn't directly match to any other resource. To compose this ID, you can take the ID Logic App Workflow and append `/triggers/{name of the trigger}`.
