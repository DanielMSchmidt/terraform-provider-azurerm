```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new azurerm.aadb2CDirectory.Aadb2CDirectory(this, "example", {
      countryCode: "US",
      dataResidencyLocation: "United States",

      domainName: "exampleb2ctenant.onmicrosoft.com",
      resourceGroupName: "example-rg",
      skuName: "PremiumP1",
    });
  }
}

```

## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `countryCode` - (Optional) Country code of the B2C tenant. The `countryCode` should be valid for the specified `dataResidencyLocation`. See [official docs](https://aka.ms/B2CDataResidency) for valid country codes. Required when creating a new resource. Changing this forces a new AAD B2C Directory to be created.

* `dataResidencyLocation` - (Required) Location in which the B2C tenant is hosted and data resides. The `dataResidencyLocation` should be valid for the specified `countryCode`. See [official docs](https://aka.ms/B2CDataResidenc) for more information. Changing this forces a new AAD B2C Directory to be created. Possible values are `Asia Pacific`, `australia`, `europe`, `global` and `United States`.

* `displayName` - (Optional) The initial display name of the B2C tenant. Required when creating a new resource. Changing this forces a new AAD B2C Directory to be created.

* `domainName` - (Required) Domain name of the B2C tenant, including the `onmicrosoftCom` suffix. Changing this forces a new AAD B2C Directory to be created.

* `resourceGroupName` - (Required) The name of the Resource Group where the AAD B2C Directory should exist. Changing this forces a new AAD B2C Directory to be created.

* `skuName` - (Required) Billing SKU for the B2C tenant. Must be one of: `premiumP1` or `premiumP2` (`standard` is not supported). See [official docs](https://aka.ms/b2cBilling) for more information.
