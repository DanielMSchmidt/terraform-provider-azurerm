# azurerm_orbital_spacecraft

Manages a Spacecraft.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
      this,
      "example",
      {
        location: "West Europe",
        name: "rg-example",
      }
    );
    const azurermOrbitalSpacecraftExample =
      new azurerm.orbitalSpacecraft.OrbitalSpacecraft(this, "example_1", {
        links: [
          {
            bandwidthMhz: 100,
            centerFrequencyMhz: 101,
            direction: "Uplink",
            name: "examplename",
            polarization: "LHCP",
          },
        ],
        location: "westeurope",
        name: "example-spacecraft",
        noradId: "12345",
        resourceGroupName: cdktf.Token.asString(
          azurermResourceGroupExample.name
        ),
        tags: {
          "aks-managed-cluster-name": "9a57225d-a405-4d40-aa46-f13d2342abef",
        },
        titleLine: "AQUA",
        twoLineElements: [
          "1 23455U 94089A   97320.90946019  .00000140  00000-0  10191-3 0  2621",

        ],
      });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    azurermOrbitalSpacecraftExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the Spacecraft. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. 

* `resourceGroupName` - (Required) The name of the Resource Group where the Spacecraft exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) The location where the Spacecraft exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `noradId` - (Required) NORAD ID of the Spacecraft.

* `links` - (Required) A `links` block as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `twoLineElements` - (Required) A list of the two line elements (TLE), the first string being the first of the TLE, the second string being the second line of the TLE. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `titleLine` - (Required) Title of the two line elements (TLE).

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

---

A `links` block supports the following:

* `bandwidthMhz` - (Required) Bandwidth in Mhz.

* `centerFrequencyMhz` - (Required) Center frequency in Mhz.

* `direction` - (Required) Direction if the communication. Possible values are `uplink` and `downlink`.

* `polarization` - (Required) Polarization. Possible values are `rhcp`, `lhcp`, `linearVertical` and `linearHorizontal`.

* `name` - (Required) Name of the link.

---

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Spacecraft.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Spacecraft.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Spacecraft.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Spacecraft.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Spacecraft.

## Import

Spacecraft can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_orbital_spacecraft.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/group1/providers/Microsoft.Orbital/spacecrafts/spacecraft1
```
