# azurerm_dns_srv_record

Enables you to manage DNS SRV Records within Azure DNS.

~> **Note:** [The Azure DNS API has a throttle limit of 500 read (GET) operations per 5 minutes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/request-limits-and-throttling#network-throttling) - whilst the default read timeouts will work for most cases - in larger configurations you may need to set a larger [read timeout](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) then the default 5min. Although, we'd generally recommend that you split the resources out into smaller Terraform configurations to avoid the problem entirely.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
      this,
      "example",
      {
        location: "West Europe",
        name: "example-resources",
      }
    );
    const azurermDnsZoneExample = new azurerm.dnsZone.DnsZone(
      this,
      "example_1",
      {
        name: "mydomain.com",
        resourceGroupName: cdktf.Token.asString(
          azurermResourceGroupExample.name
        ),
      }
    );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    azurermDnsZoneExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
    const azurermDnsSrvRecordExample = new azurerm.dnsSrvRecord.DnsSrvRecord(
      this,
      "example_2",
      {
        name: "test",
        record: [
          {
            port: 8080,
            priority: 1,
            target: "target1.contoso.com",
            weight: 5,
          },
        ],
        resourceGroupName: cdktf.Token.asString(
          azurermResourceGroupExample.name
        ),
        tags: {
          Environment: "Production",
        },
        ttl: 300,
        zoneName: cdktf.Token.asString(azurermDnsZoneExample.name),
      }
    );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    azurermDnsSrvRecordExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the DNS SRV Record. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resourceGroupName` - (Required) Specifies the resource group where the DNS Zone (parent resource) exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `zoneName` - (Required) Specifies the DNS Zone where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `ttl` - (Required) The Time To Live (TTL) of the DNS record in seconds.

* `record` - (Required) A list of values that make up the SRV record. Each `record` block supports fields documented below.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

---

The `record` block supports:

* `priority` - (Required) Priority of the SRV record.

* `weight` - (Required) Weight of the SRV record.

* `port` - (Required) Port the service is listening on.

* `target` - (Required) FQDN of the service.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The DNS SRV Record ID.

* `fqdn` - The FQDN of the DNS SRV Record.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the DNS SRV Record.

* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the DNS SRV Record.

* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the DNS SRV Record.

* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the DNS SRV Record.

## Import

SRV records can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_dns_srv_record.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.Network/dnsZones/zone1/SRV/myrecord1
```
