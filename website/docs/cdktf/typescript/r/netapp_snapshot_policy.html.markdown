## NetApp Snapshot Policy Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
      this,
      "example",
      {
        location: "East US",
        name: "resource-group-01",
      }
    );
    const azurermNetappAccountExample = new azurerm.netappAccount.NetappAccount(
      this,
      "example_1",
      {
        location: cdktf.Token.asString(azurermResourceGroupExample.location),
        name: "netappaccount-01",
        resourceGroupName: cdktf.Token.asString(
          azurermResourceGroupExample.name
        ),
      }
    );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    azurermNetappAccountExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
    const azurermNetappSnapshotPolicyExample =
      new azurerm.netappSnapshotPolicy.NetappSnapshotPolicy(this, "example_2", {
        accountName: cdktf.Token.asString(azurermNetappAccountExample.name),
        dailySchedule: {
          hour: 20,

        enabled: true,
        hourlySchedule: {
          minute: 15,
          snapshotsToKeep: 4,
        },
        location: cdktf.Token.asString(azurermResourceGroupExample.location),
        monthlySchedule: {
          daysOfMonth: [1, 15, 20, 30],
          hour: 5,
          minute: 45,

          daysOfWeek: ["Monday", "Friday"],
          hour: 23,
          minute: 0,

        },
      });
