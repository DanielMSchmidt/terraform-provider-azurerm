# azurerm_logic_app_action_http

Manages an HTTP Action within a Logic App Workflow

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
      this,
      "example",
      {
        location: "West Europe",
        name: "workflow-resources",
      }
    );
    const azurermLogicAppWorkflowExample =
      new azurerm.logicAppWorkflow.LogicAppWorkflow(this, "example_1", {
        location: cdktf.Token.asString(azurermResourceGroupExample.location),
        name: "workflow1",
        resourceGroupName: cdktf.Token.asString(
          azurermResourceGroupExample.name
        ),
      });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    azurermLogicAppWorkflowExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
    const azurermLogicAppActionHttpExample =
      new azurerm.logicAppActionHttp.LogicAppActionHttp(this, "example_2", {
        logicAppId: cdktf.Token.asString(azurermLogicAppWorkflowExample.id),
        method: "GET",
        name: "webhook",
        uri: "http://example.com/some-webhook",
      });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    azurermLogicAppActionHttpExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the HTTP Action to be created within the Logic App Workflow. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

-> **NOTE:** This name must be unique across all Actions within the Logic App Workflow.

* `logicAppId` - (Required) Specifies the ID of the Logic App Workflow. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `method` - (Required) Specifies the HTTP Method which should be used for this HTTP Action. Possible values include `delete`, `get`, `patch`, `post` and `put`.

* `uri` - (Required) Specifies the URI which will be called when this HTTP Action is triggered.

* `body` - (Optional) Specifies the HTTP Body that should be sent to the `uri` when this HTTP Action is triggered.

* `headers` - (Optional) Specifies a Map of Key-Value Pairs that should be sent to the `uri` when this HTTP Action is triggered.

* `queries` - (Optional) Specifies a Map of Key-Value Pairs that should be sent to the `uri` when this HTTP Action is triggered.

* `runAfter` - (Optional) Specifies the place of the HTTP Action in the Logic App Workflow. If not specified, the HTTP Action is right after the Trigger. A `runAfter` block is as defined below.

---

A `runAfter` block supports the following:

* `actionName` - (Required) Specifies the name of the precedent HTTP Action.

* `actionResult` - (Required) Specifies the expected result of the precedent HTTP Action, only after which the current HTTP Action will be triggered. Possible values include `succeeded`, `failed`, `skipped` and `timedOut`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the HTTP Action within the Logic App Workflow.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Logic App HTTP Action.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Logic App HTTP Action.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Logic App HTTP Action.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Logic App HTTP Action.

## Import

Logic App HTTP Actions can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_logic_app_action_http.webhook1 /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.Logic/workflows/workflow1/actions/webhook1
```

-> **NOTE:** This ID is unique to Terraform and doesn't directly match to any other resource. To compose this ID, you can take the ID Logic App Workflow and append `/actions/{name of the action}`.
