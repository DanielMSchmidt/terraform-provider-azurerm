import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
      this,
      "example",
      {
        location: "West Europe",
        name: "example-logz",
      }
    );
    const azurermLogzMonitorExample = new azurerm.logzMonitor.LogzMonitor(
      this,
      "example_1",
      {
        location: cdktf.Token.asString(azurermResourceGroupExample.location),
        name: "example-monitor",
        plan: {
          billingCycle: "MONTHLY",
          effectiveDate: "2022-06-06T00:00:00Z",
          usageType: "COMMITTED",
        },
        resourceGroupName: cdktf.Token.asString(
          azurermResourceGroupExample.name
        ),
        user: {
          email: "user@example.com",

          phoneNumber: "+12313803556",
        },
      }
    );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    azurermLogzMonitorExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```
