# azurerm_local_network_gateway

Manages a local network gateway connection over which specific connections can be configured.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
      this,
      "example",
      {
        location: "West Europe",
        name: "localNetworkGWTest",
      }
    );
    new azurerm.localNetworkGateway.LocalNetworkGateway(this, "home", {
      addressSpace: ["10.0.0.0/16"],
      gatewayAddress: "12.13.14.15",
      location: cdktf.Token.asString(azurermResourceGroupExample.location),
      name: "backHome",
      resourceGroupName: cdktf.Token.asString(azurermResourceGroupExample.name),
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the local network gateway. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resourceGroupName` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to create the local network gateway. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) The location/region where the local network gateway is created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `addressSpace` - (Optional) The list of string CIDRs representing the address spaces the gateway exposes.

* `bgpSettings` - (Optional) A `bgpSettings` block as defined below containing the Local Network Gateway's BGP speaker settings.

* `gatewayAddress` - (Optional) The gateway IP address to connect with.

* `gatewayFqdn` - (Optional) The gateway FQDN to connect with.

-> **NOTE:** Either `gatewayAddress` or `gatewayFqdn` should be specified.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

---

The `bgpSettings` block supports the following:

* `asn` - (Required) The BGP speaker's ASN.

* `bgpPeeringAddress` - (Required) The BGP peering address and BGP identifier of this BGP speaker.

* `peerWeight` - (Optional) The weight added to routes learned from this BGP speaker.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Local Network Gateway.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Local Network Gateway.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Local Network Gateway.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Local Network Gateway.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Local Network Gateway.

## Import

Local Network Gateways can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_local_network_gateway.lng1 /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.Network/localNetworkGateways/lng1
