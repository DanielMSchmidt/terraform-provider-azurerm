# azurerm_communication_service

Manages a Communication Service.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
      this,
      "example",
      {
        location: "West Europe",
        name: "example-resources",
      }
    );
    const azurermCommunicationServiceExample =
      new azurerm.communicationService.CommunicationService(this, "example_1", {
        dataLocation: "United States",
        name: "example-communicationservice",
        resourceGroupName: cdktf.Token.asString(
          azurermResourceGroupExample.name
        ),
      });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    azurermCommunicationServiceExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```
