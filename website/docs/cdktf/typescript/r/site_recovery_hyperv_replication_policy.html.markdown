# azurerm_site_recovery_hyperv_replication_policy

Manages a Azure Site Recovery replication policy for HyperV within a Recovery Vault. Replication policies define the frequency at which recovery points are created and how long they are stored.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const azurermResourceGroupExample = new azurerm.resourceGroup.ResourceGroup(
      this,
      "example",
      {
        location: "East US",
        name: "example-rg",
      }
    );
    const azurermRecoveryServicesVaultVault =
      new azurerm.recoveryServicesVault.RecoveryServicesVault(this, "vault", {
        location: cdktf.Token.asString(azurermResourceGroupExample.location),
        name: "example-recovery-vault",
        resourceGroupName: cdktf.Token.asString(
          azurermResourceGroupExample.name
        ),
        sku: "Standard",
      });
    new azurerm.siteRecoveryHypervReplicationPolicy.SiteRecoveryHypervReplicationPolicy(
      this,
      "policy",
      {
        applicationConsistentSnapshotFrequencyInHours: 1,
        name: "policy",
        recoveryPointRetentionInHours: 2,
        recoveryVaultId: cdktf.Token.asString(
          azurermRecoveryServicesVaultVault.id
        ),
        replicationIntervalInSeconds: 300,
      }
    );
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the replication policy. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resourceGroupName` - (Required) Name of the resource group where the vault that should be updated is located. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `recoveryVaultName` - (Required) The name of the vault that should be updated. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `recoveryPointRetentionInHours` - (Required) The duration in hours for which the recovery points need to be stored.

* `applicationConsistentSnapshotFrequencyInHours` - (Required) Specifies the frequency at which to create application consistent recovery points.

* `replicationIntervalInSeconds` - (Required) Specifies how frequently data should be synchronized between source and target locations. Possible values are `30` and `300`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Site Recovery Replication Policy.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Site Recovery Replication Policy.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Site Recovery Replication Policy.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Site Recovery Replication Policy.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Site Recovery Replication Policy.

## Import

Site Recovery Replication Policies can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_site_recovery_hyperv_replication_policy.mypolicy /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/resource-group-name/providers/Microsoft.RecoveryServices/vaults/recovery-vault-name/replicationPolicies/policy-name
```
