class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const dataAzurermSynapseWorkspaceExample =
      new azurerm.dataAzurermSynapseWorkspace.DataAzurermSynapseWorkspace(
        this,
        "example",
        {
          name: "existing",
