import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const dataAzurermPrivateDnsZoneExample =
      new azurerm.dataAzurermPrivateDnsZone.DataAzurermPrivateDnsZone(
        this,
        "example",
        {
          name: "contoso.internal",
          resourceGroupName: "contoso-dns",
        }
      );
    new cdktf.TerraformOutput(this, "private_dns_zone_id", {
