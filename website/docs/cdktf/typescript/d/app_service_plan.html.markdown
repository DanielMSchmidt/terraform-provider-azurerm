# Data Source: azurerm_app_service_plan

Use this data source to access information about an existing App Service Plan (formerly known as a `Server Farm`).

!> **Note:** The `azurermAppServicePlan` data source is deprecated in version 3.0 of the AzureRM provider and will be removed in version 4.0. Please use the [`azurermServicePlan`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/data-sources/service_plan) data source instead.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const dataAzurermAppServicePlanExample =
      new azurerm.dataAzurermAppServicePlan.DataAzurermAppServicePlan(
        this,
        "example",
        {
          name: "search-app-service-plan",
          resourceGroupName: "search-service",
        }
      );
    new cdktf.TerraformOutput(this, "app_service_plan_id", {
      value: dataAzurermAppServicePlanExample.id,
    });
  }
}

```
