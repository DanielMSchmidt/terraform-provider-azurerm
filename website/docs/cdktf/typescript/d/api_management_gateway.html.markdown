# Data Source: azurerm_api_management_gateway

Use this data source to access information about an existing API Management Gateway.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const dataAzurermApiManagementExample =
      new azurerm.dataAzurermApiManagement.DataAzurermApiManagement(
        this,
        "example",
        {
          name: "example-apim",
          resourceGroupName: "example-rg",
        }
      );
    const dataAzurermApiManagementGatewayExample =
      new azurerm.dataAzurermApiManagementGateway.DataAzurermApiManagementGateway(
        this,
        "example_1",
        {
          apiManagementId: cdktf.Token.asString(
            dataAzurermApiManagementExample.id
          ),
          name: "example-api-gateway",
        }
      );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    dataAzurermApiManagementGatewayExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}
