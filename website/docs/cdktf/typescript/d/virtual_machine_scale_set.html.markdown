# Data Source: azurerm_virtual_machine_scale_set

Use this data source to access information about an existing Virtual Machine Scale Set.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const dataAzurermVirtualMachineScaleSetExample =
      new azurerm.dataAzurermVirtualMachineScaleSet.DataAzurermVirtualMachineScaleSet(
        this,
        "example",
        {
          name: "existing",
          resourceGroupName: "existing",
        }
      );
    new cdktf.TerraformOutput(this, "id", {
      value: dataAzurermVirtualMachineScaleSetExample.id,
    });
  }
}

```

## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of this Virtual Machine Scale Set.
