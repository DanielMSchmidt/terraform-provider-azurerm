# Data Source: azurerm_virtual_machine

Use this data source to access information about an existing Virtual Machine.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new azurerm.provider.AzurermProvider(this, "azurerm", {
      features: {},
    });
    const dataAzurermVirtualMachineExample =
      new azurerm.dataAzurermVirtualMachine.DataAzurermVirtualMachine(
        this,
        "example",
        {
          name: "production",
          resourceGroupName: "networking",
        }
      );
    new cdktf.TerraformOutput(this, "virtual_machine_id", {
      value: dataAzurermVirtualMachineExample.id,
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

* `name` - Specifies the name of the Virtual Machine.

* `resourceGroupName` - Specifies the name of the resource group the Virtual Machine is located in.

## Attributes Reference

* `id` - The ID of the Virtual Machine.

* `identity` - A `identity` block as defined below.

* `privateIpAddress` - The Primary Private IP Address assigned to this Virtual Machine.

* `privateIpAddresses` - A list of Private IP Addresses assigned to this Virtual Machine.

* `publicIpAddress` - The Primary Public IP Address assigned to this Virtual Machine.

* `publicIpAddresses` - A list of the Public IP Addresses assigned to this Virtual Machine.

* `powerState` - The power state of the virtual machine.

~> In this release there's a known issue where the `publicIpAddress` and `publicIpAddresses` fields may not be fully populated for Dynamic Public IP's.

---

An `identity` block exports the following:

* `identityIds` - The list of User Managed Identity IDs which are assigned to the Virtual Machine.

* `principalId` - The ID of the System Managed Service Principal assigned to the Virtual Machine.

* `tenantId` - The ID of the Tenant of the System Managed Service Principal assigned to the Virtual Machine.

* `type` - The identity type of the Managed Identity assigned to the Virtual Machine.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Virtual Machine.
