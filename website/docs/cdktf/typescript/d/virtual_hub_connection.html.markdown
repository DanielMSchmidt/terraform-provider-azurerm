# Data Source: azurerm_virtual_hub_connection

Uses this data source to access information about an existing Virtual Hub Connection.

## Virtual Hub Connection Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const dataAzurermVirtualHubConnectionExample =
      new azurerm.dataAzurermVirtualHubConnection.DataAzurermVirtualHubConnection(
        this,
        "example",
        {
          name: "example-connection",
          resourceGroupName: "example-resources",
          virtualHubName: "example-hub-name",
        }
      );
    new cdktf.TerraformOutput(this, "virtual_hub_connection_id", {
      value: dataAzurermVirtualHubConnectionExample.id,
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - The name of the Connection which should be retrieved.

* `resourceGroupName` - The Name of the Resource Group where the Virtual Hub Connection exists.

*  `virtualHubName` - The name of the Virtual Hub where this Connection exists.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Virtual Hub Connection.

* `virtualHubId` - The ID of the Virtual Hub within which this connection is created

* `remoteVirtualNetworkId` - The ID of the Virtual Network which the Virtual Hub is connected

* `internetSecurityEnabled` - Whether Internet Security is enabled to secure internet traffic on this connection

* `routing` - A `routing` block as defined below.

---

An `routing` block exports the following:

* `associatedRouteTableId` - The ID of the route table associated with this Virtual Hub connection.

* `propagatedRouteTable` - A `propagatedRouteTable` block as defined below.

* `staticVnetRoute` - A `staticVnetRoute` block as defined below.

---

A `propagatedRouteTable` block supports the following:

* `labels` - The list of labels assigned to this route table.

* `routeTableIds` - A list of Route Table IDs associated with this Virtual Hub Connection.

---

A `staticVnetRoute` block supports the following:

* `name` - The name which is used for this Static Route.

* `addressPrefixes` - A list of CIDR Ranges which is used as Address Prefixes.

* `nextHopIpAddress` - The IP Address which is used for the Next Hop.

## Timeouts
