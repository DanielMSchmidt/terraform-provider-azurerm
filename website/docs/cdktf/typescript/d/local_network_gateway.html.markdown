# Data Source: azurerm_local_network_gateway

Use this data source to access information about an existing Local Network Gateway.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const dataAzurermLocalNetworkGatewayExample =
      new azurerm.dataAzurermLocalNetworkGateway.DataAzurermLocalNetworkGateway(
        this,
        "example",
        {
          name: "existing-local-network-gateway",
          resourceGroupName: "existing-resources",
        }
      );
    new cdktf.TerraformOutput(this, "id", {
      value: dataAzurermLocalNetworkGatewayExample.id,
    });
  }
}

```
