# Data Source: azurerm_blueprint_definition

Use this data source to access information about an existing Azure Blueprint Definition

~> **NOTE:** Azure Blueprints are in Preview and potentially subject to breaking change without notice.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const dataAzurermClientConfigCurrent =
      new azurerm.dataAzurermClientConfig.DataAzurermClientConfig(
        this,
        "current",
        {}
      );
    const dataAzurermManagementGroupRoot =
      new azurerm.dataAzurermManagementGroup.DataAzurermManagementGroup(
        this,
        "root",
        {
          name: cdktf.Token.asString(dataAzurermClientConfigCurrent.tenantId),
        }
      );
    new azurerm.dataAzurermBlueprintDefinition.DataAzurermBlueprintDefinition(
      this,
      "example",
      {
        name: "exampleManagementGroupBP",
        scopeId: cdktf.Token.asString(dataAzurermManagementGroupRoot.id),
      }
    );
  }
}

```
