# Data Source: azurerm_private_dns_a_record

Use this data source to access information about an existing Private DNS A Record within Azure DNS.

~> **Note:** [The Azure DNS API has a throttle limit of 500 read (GET) operations per 5 minutes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/request-limits-and-throttling#network-throttling) - whilst the default read timeouts will work for most cases - in larger configurations you may need to set a larger [read timeout](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) then the default 5min. Although, we'd generally recommend that you split the resources out into smaller Terraform configurations to avoid the problem entirely.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const dataAzurermPrivateDnsARecordExample =
      new azurerm.dataAzurermPrivateDnsARecord.DataAzurermPrivateDnsARecord(
        this,
        "example",
        {
          name: "test",
          resourceGroupName: "test-rg",
          zoneName: "test-zone",
        }
      );
    new cdktf.TerraformOutput(this, "private_dns_a_record_id", {
      value: dataAzurermPrivateDnsARecordExample.id,
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

* `name` - The name of the Private DNS A Record.

* `resourceGroupName` - Specifies the resource group where the Private DNS Zone (parent resource) exists.

* `zoneName` - Specifies the Private DNS Zone where the resource exists.

## Attributes Reference

* `id` - The Private DNS A Record ID.

* `fqdn` - The FQDN of the Private DNS A Record.

* `ttl` - The Time To Live (TTL) of the Private DNS record in seconds.

* `records` - List of IPv4 Addresses.

* `tags` - A mapping of tags assigned to the Private DNS A Record.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Private DNS A Record.
