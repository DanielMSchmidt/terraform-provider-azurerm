# Data Source: azurerm_virtual_hub_route_table

Uses this data source to access information about an existing Virtual Hub Route Table.

## Virtual Hub Route Table Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const dataAzurermVirtualHubRouteTableExample =
      new azurerm.dataAzurermVirtualHubRouteTable.DataAzurermVirtualHubRouteTable(
        this,
        "example",
        {
          name: "example-hub-route-table",
          resourceGroupName: "example-resources",
          virtualHubName: "example-hub-name",
        }
      );
    new cdktf.TerraformOutput(this, "virtual_hub_route_table_id", {
      value: dataAzurermVirtualHubRouteTableExample.id,
    });
  }
}

```
