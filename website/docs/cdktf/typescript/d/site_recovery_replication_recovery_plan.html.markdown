/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const dataAzurermRecoveryServicesVaultVault =
      new azurerm.dataAzurermRecoveryServicesVault.DataAzurermRecoveryServicesVault(
        this,
        "vault",
        {
          name: "tfex-recovery_vault",
          resourceGroupName: "tfex-resource_group",
        }
      );
    new azurerm.dataAzurermSiteRecoveryReplicationRecoveryPlan.DataAzurermSiteRecoveryReplicationRecoveryPlan(
      this,
      "example",
      {
        name: "example-recovery-plan",
        recoveryVaultId: cdktf.Token.asString(
