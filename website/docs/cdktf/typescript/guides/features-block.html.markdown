# The Features Block

The Azure Provider allows the behaviour of certain resources to be configured using the `features` block.

This allows different users to select the behaviour they require, for example some users may wish for the OS Disks for a Virtual Machine to be removed automatically when the Virtual Machine is destroyed - whereas other users may wish for these OS Disks to be detached but not deleted.

## Example Usage

If you wish to use the default behaviours of the Azure Provider, then you only need to define an empty `features` block as below:

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new azurerm.provider.AzurermProvider(this, "azurerm", {
      features: {},
    });
  }
}

```

Each of the blocks defined below can be optionally specified to configure the behaviour as needed - this example shows all the possible behaviours which can be configured:

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as azurerm from "./.gen/providers/azurerm";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new azurerm.provider.AzurermProvider(this, "azurerm", {
      features: {
        apiManagement: {
          purgeSoftDeleteOnDestroy: true,
          recoverSoftDeleted: true,
        },
        appConfiguration: {
          purgeSoftDeleteOnDestroy: true,
          recoverSoftDeleted: true,
        },
        applicationInsights: {
          disableGeneratedRule: false,
        },
        cognitiveAccount: {
          purgeSoftDeleteOnDestroy: true,
        },
        keyVault: {
          purgeSoftDeleteOnDestroy: true,
          recoverSoftDeletedKeyVaults: true,
        },
        logAnalyticsWorkspace: {
          permanentlyDeleteOnDestroy: true,
        },
        managedDisk: {
          expandWithoutDowntime: true,
        },
        resourceGroup: {
          preventDeletionIfContainsResources: true,
        },
        templateDeployment: {
          deleteNestedItemsDuringDeletion: true,
        },
        virtualMachine: {
          deleteOsDiskOnDeletion: true,
          gracefulShutdown: false,
          skipShutdownAndForceDelete: false,
        },
        virtualMachineScaleSet: {
          forceDelete: false,
          rollInstancesWhenRequired: true,
          scaleToZeroBeforeDeletion: true,
        },
      },
    });
  }
}

```

~> **Note:** When recovering soft-deleted Key Vault items (Keys, Certificates, and Secrets) the Principal used by Terraform needs the `"recover"` permission.

---

The `logAnalyticsWorkspace` block supports the following:

* `permanentlyDeleteOnDestroy` - (Optional) Should the `azurermLogAnalyticsWorkspace` be permanently deleted (e.g. purged) when destroyed? Defaults to `true`.

-> **Note:** This will be defaulted to `false` in the next major version of the Azure Provider (4.0).

---

The `managedDisk` block supports the following:

* `expandWithoutDowntime` - (Optional) Specifies whether Managed Disks which can be Expanded without Downtime (on either [a Linux VM](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/expand-disks?tabs=azure-cli%2Cubuntu#expand-without-downtime) [or a Windows VM](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/expand-os-disk#expand-without-downtime)) should be expanded without restarting the associated Virtual Machine. Defaults to `true`.

~> **Note:** Expand Without Downtime requires a specific configuration for the Managed Disk and Virtual Machine - Terraform will use Expand Without Downtime when the Managed Disk and Virtual Machine meet these requirements, and shut the Virtual Machine down as needed if this is inapplicable. More information on when Expand Without Downtime is applicable can be found in the [Linux VM](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/expand-disks?tabs=azure-cli%2Cubuntu#expand-without-downtime) [or Windows VM](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/expand-os-disk#expand-without-downtime) documentation.

---

The `resourceGroup` block supports the following:

* `preventDeletionIfContainsResources` - (Optional) Should the `azurermResourceGroup` resource check that there are no Resources within the Resource Group during deletion? This means that all Resources within the Resource Group must be deleted prior to deleting the Resource Group. Defaults to `true`.

---

The `templateDeployment` block supports the following:

* `deleteNestedItemsDuringDeletion` - (Optional) Should the `azurermResourceGroupTemplateDeployment` resource attempt to delete resources that have been provisioned by the ARM Template, when the Resource Group Template Deployment is deleted? Defaults to `true`.

---

The `virtualMachine` block supports the following:

* `deleteOsDiskOnDeletion` - (Optional) Should the `azurermLinuxVirtualMachine` and `azurermWindowsVirtualMachine` resources delete the OS Disk attached to the Virtual Machine when the Virtual Machine is destroyed? Defaults to `true`.

~> **Note:** This does not affect the older `azurermVirtualMachine` resource, which has its own flags for managing this within the resource.

* `gracefulShutdown` - (Optional) Should the `azurermLinuxVirtualMachine` and `azurermWindowsVirtualMachine` request a graceful shutdown when the Virtual Machine is destroyed? Defaults to `false`.

~> **Note:** When using a graceful shutdown, Azure gives the Virtual Machine a 5 minutes window in which to complete the shutdown process, at which point the machine will be force powered off - [more information can be found in this blog post](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/linux-and-graceful-shutdowns-2/).

* `skipShutdownAndForceDelete` - Should the `azurermLinuxVirtualMachine` and `azurermWindowsVirtualMachine` skip the shutdown command and `Force Delete`, this provides the ability to forcefully and immediately delete the VM and detach all sub-resources associated with the virtual machine. This allows those freed resources to be reattached to another VM instance or deleted. Defaults to `false`.

~> **Note:** Support for Force Delete is in an opt-in Preview.

---

The `virtualMachineScaleSet` block supports the following:

* `forceDelete` - Should the `azurermLinuxVirtualMachineScaleSet` and `azurermWindowsVirtualMachineScaleSet` resources `Force Delete`, this provides the ability to forcefully and immediately delete the VM and detach all sub-resources associated with the virtual machine. This allows those freed resources to be reattached to another VM instance or deleted. Defaults to `false`.

~> **Note:** Support for Force Delete is in an opt-in Preview.

* `rollInstancesWhenRequired` - (Optional) Should the `azurermLinuxVirtualMachineScaleSet` and `azurermWindowsVirtualMachineScaleSet` resources automatically roll the instances in the Scale Set when Required (for example when updating the Sku/Image). Defaults to `true`.

* `scaleToZeroBeforeDeletion` - (Optional) Should the `azurermLinuxVirtualMachineScaleSet` and `azurermWindowsVirtualMachineScaleSet` resources scale to 0 instances before deleting the resource. Defaults to `true`.
